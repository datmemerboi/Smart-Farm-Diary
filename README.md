# Smart Farm Diary
##	A Web App for farmers' needs
### Using PHP, HTML, JS, and MySQL
A project requested for ***Smart India Hackathon (2018)***, SFD is a website that will help solve farmers' issues.

The main aim of this app is to help farmers calculate & maintain their expenses while suggesting if the rates are very high.

We can **calculate expenses**, **update any current expenses** and **search** for products & rates nearby.

**Note:**

For the time being, the entire project has been uploaded onto this repo. Updates and re-arrangements will be completed shortly.
